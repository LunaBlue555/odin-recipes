            <li>Preheat the oven to 375â„‰ degrees. Grease an 8x8 baking dish with oil.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine oats, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt. Mix to combine.</li>

            <li>Spread into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Oatmeal is done baking when it is puffed up on the edges, set in the middle and top is golden.</li>
            <li>Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing. It will be soft at first but will firm up as it cools.

Let cool completely and store in fridge for up to 4 days.</li>
